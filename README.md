The objective here is to get out of the labyrinth (green square)

There are enemies that can kill you (avoid them)

To walk, use *a* and *d* alternately. They correspond to the legs.

With your mouse, you choose the direction you are facing and where your flashlight lights.

 TODO:
 
 Enemies' AI with a simple markov chain and A*
 exit emitting a glow
 3d sound 
 better collisions
 gun maybe?
